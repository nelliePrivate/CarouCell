Find how to set up this experiment, and to create your own with this two part blog.

PART 1 is the initial set up.  Think, if I was running an actual experiment, what things do I need to complete and test my theory?
Setting up and making sure all necessary components are functioning and present can keep the heavier bits of coding from becoming problematic.

PART 2 is the more technical bits of code that control what it is we want our experiment to demonstrate. Or in the case of creating a feature, what we want that feature to do.
